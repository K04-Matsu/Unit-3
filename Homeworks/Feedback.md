# Feedback for Elia Kobayashiâ€™s repositories. 

### Journal-Elia: Overall tasks and quizzes are uploaded, however, there may be revise required for an easy repository. (Eg, bundle tasks or quizzes into a folder ) On the other hand, for general code writing, variables names are simple and understandable, documentation helps the viewer to get the flow. And thus, overall great coding practice.

### Unit_3_Project: All conditions for criteria A are there, and well descriptive. Research and correlating citations can be seen. Excellent progress considering the deadline, and would like to see this dedication kept.

                                                                                                               600characters
